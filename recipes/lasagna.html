        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish we call lasagna has been called, for most of its existence, and in most parts of the world, lasagne. Lasagna is singular, and lasagne is plural. The exact etymology of the word is unclear, but it has referred to a wide sheet of pasta that is placed in a pot with food served on top of it for a very long time.</p>
